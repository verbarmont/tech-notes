I have been trying to find a way to circumvent China's notorious Internet censorship, or GFW (the Great Firewall), or simply the *Wall* as it's often called. 

Until recently I have been using a commercial VPN service called ExpressVPN that costs 12 US dollars a month. It works in most cases, but very often it takes numerous re-tries to connect to their servers, and the connection gets dropped constantly.

Then one day I checked out the mighty Zhihu (知乎) website which is the Chinese equivalent to Quora. Some guy suggested that due to the increasingly sophisticated cyber arsenals of Chinese government, almost all conventional VPN services are disrupted to different extends. That's what I have suspected as well. But what's the counter act aside from just putting up with it? They said that a specific tool called Shadowsocks still works fairly well because of its very nature that makes it hard for the censorship apparatus to detect and disrupt.
